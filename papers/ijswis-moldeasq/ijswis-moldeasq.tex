\begin{abstract}
The present paper introduces a technique based on checking a set of 196
predefined criteria to assess linked data quality according to different
dimensions. The growing interest in promoting raw data to the Linked Data
initiative has implied the definition of life cycles that enable the right
management of all processes involved in the deployment of a data-based
infrastructure. Although the most relevant steps have been covered and defined
by these methodologies or best practices the real support to validate the
promoted data from structural, access or data integrity points of view is far
from being fully developed. That is why in this work authors compile a set of
criteria coming from existing specifications, best practices, methodologies and
tools to establish a multidimensional set of validation criteria that can be
checked through  a semi-automatic approach. Moreover the proposed technique is
applied to evaluate the quality of public procurement data coming from different
and relevant data sources in the European Union with the aim of demonstrating
both: 1) the adequacy of this technique to assess quality in the new of web of
data and 2) the status of data quality in the European e-Procurement sector.
Finally the learned lessons and restrictions of the presented method are
discussed  to conclude with some remarks and future directions.

% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the conference you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals/conferences frown on
% math in the abstract anyway.
