\begin{abstract}
The present paper introduces a method to promote existing controlled vocabularies to 
the Linked Data initiative. A common data model and an enclosed conversion 
method for knowledge organization systems based on semantic web technologies and 
vocabularies such as SKOS are presented. This method is applied to well-known 
taxonomies and controlled vocabularies in the business sector, more specifically 
to Product Scheme Classifications created by governmental institutions such as 
the European Union or the United Nations. Since these product schemes are 
available in a common and shared data model, the needs of the European 
e-Procurement sector are outlined to finally demonstrate how Linked Data can 
address some of the challenges for publishing and retrieving information 
resources. As a consequence, two experiments are also provided in order to 
validate the gain, in terms of expressivity, and the exploitation of this emerging 
approach to help both expert and end-users to make decisions on the selection of descriptors 
for public procurement notices.

\section{Conclusions and Future work}\label{sect:conclusions}
The main advantage of applying Linked Data to PSCs lies in the possibility of enhancing the number of terms to 
build enriched SPARQL queries. Thus, a broader input vocabulary can ease the access to more and newer 
public procurement notices as. In the European e-Procurement context, this work represents 
a step-forward to a new data realm in which public procurement data must be a key-enabler for the next 
data-based economy easing the access to business opportunities to companies, specially SMEs, 
and creating the appropriate environment for a real EU-wide public market. According to the EC, e-Procurement may, 
by its nature, be more compatible or facilitate the use of procurement budgets in support of the 
EU 2020 objectives. Some countries have adopted the recommendations of the EU introducing strategies to encourage SMEs 
participation in the procurement processes but the intended participation of the SMEs is still far from the EU expectations. 
That is why the e-Procurement sector must take advantage of the LOD initiative to boost and encourage 
the access to public procurement opportunities.

On the other hand, the exploitation of Linked Data to create a decision support system helping users to select CPV codes 
from user queries is still an open issue that must be improved applying more advanced techniques: in-depth analysis of the CPV codes, 
make correlations with other variables, etc. Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that the advantages of promoting public procurement 
data, with special focus on PSCs, can bridge the gap between human readable formats and machine-processable data. Moreover, 
this work is part of the MOLDEAS platform in which the application of Linked Data principles to the e-Procurement sector has a 
broader scope. The PSC reconciliation service has been also applied to the ``PublicSpending.net'' initiative with the aim 
of comparing the public spending around the world. Further steps include the application of the life-cycle (and its refinement) 
to other relevant PSCs such UNSPSC, NACE or TARIC, the improvement of the reconciliation service, the deployment of 
a PSCs portal similar to the ``NCBO BioPortal'' and the reporting of results to: 1) the Office for Official Publications 
of the European Communities; 2) the ``Internal Market and Services Directorate General'' and 3) the ``Information
Society and Media Directorate General'' of the European Commission. As final future actions, 
this work must be aligned to current research trends such as: data quality~\cite{bizer2007,Bizer2009QA,lodq,link-qa}, 
provenance~\cite{DBLP:conf/ipaw/HartigZ10}, trust~\cite{Carroll05namedgraphs}, large dataset processing~\cite{DBLP:conf/closer/HausenblasGHC12},
entity reconciliation~\cite{Maali_Cyganiak_2011}, searching~\cite{hoga-etal-2011-swse-JWS} or inference~\cite{DBLP:journals/ws/BonattiHPS11} to name a few.
