\begin{abstract}
This article introduces a method to promote existing controlled vocabularies to 
the Linked Data initiative. A common data model and an enclosed conversion 
method for knowledge organization systems based on semantic web technologies and 
vocabularies such as SKOS are presented.  This method is applied to well-known 
taxonomies and controlled vocabularies in the business sector, more specifically 
to Product Scheme Classifications created by governmental institutions such as 
the European Union or the United Nations. Once these product schemes are 
available in a common and shared data model, the needs of the European 
e-Procurement sector are outlined to finally demonstrate how Linked Data can 
address some of the challenges for publishing and retrieving information 
resources. As a consequence, two experiments are also provided in order to 
validate the gain, in terms of expressivity, and the goodness of this emerging 
approach to help expert users to make decisions on the selection of descriptors 
for public procurement notices.

\section{Existing approaches for PROMOTING controlled vocabularies to RDF/OWL}\label{sect:thesauri}
This section discusses existing methods to convert knowledge organizations systems distinguishing between RDF/OWL 
conversions methods for thesauri and product classification systems.
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Thesauri Conversion Methods}. A thesaurus is a controlled vocabulary, with equivalent terms explicitly 
 identified and with ambiguous words or phrases (e.g. homographs) made unique. This set of terms also may include broader-narrower 
 or other relationships. Usually they are considered to be the most complex of controlled vocabularies. Thesauri as a KOS 
 system can be converted by means of different procedures. On one hand, there are methods~\cite{DBLP:conf/jcdl/Soergel05} that propose specific 
 techniques for thesauri conversions into ontology. However the method does not target a specific output format and it considers the 
 hierarchical structure of thesauri as logical is-a relationships. On the other hand, there are some generic methods 
 for thesauri conversions, as the step-wise method defined by Miles et al~\cite{DBLP:conf/esws/AssemMMS06}. This method selects a common output data model, the 
 SKOS vocabulary, and is comprised of the following sequenced steps: generation of the RDF encoding, error checking and validation 
 and publishing the RDF triples on the Web. In addition, this method has been refined (FIXME: Polo-Paredes, Álvarez-Rodríguez \& Rubiera-Azcona, 2008) 
 adding three new sub steps for generating the RDF encoding: analyzing the vocabulary, mapping the vocabulary to 
 SKOS properties and classes and building a conversion program. This initial stepwise method can be considered as 
 a previous effort to the abovementioned linked data lifecycles in which all tasks are already defined and these
 steps are embedded as part of the whole lifecycle.
 
 \item \textbf{Product Scheme Classification Conversion Methods.}
