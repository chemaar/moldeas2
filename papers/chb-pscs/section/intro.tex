Government bodies and public institutions as a whole are the most important buyers in the European Union (EU), since public procurement spending represents around 19\% of 
EU Gross Domestic Product (GDP)~\cite{d2010}. Given this situation there is a growing interest and commitment~\cite{d2010a} to ensure that these funds are 
well managed and most of inefficiencies are eliminated. Electronic public procurement or e-Procurement~\cite{Podlogar2007} emerges as an alternative to link and 
integrate inter-organizational business processes and systems with the automation of the requisitioning, the approval purchase order 
management, accounting processes among others through the Internet-based protocol. However there is much more at stake than the mere changeover 
from paper based systems to ones using electronic communications. It should have the potential to yield important improvements in the access to information and data such as the efficiency of individual purchases, 
the overall administration of public procurement or the functioning of the markets for government contracts. 

In this context the European Commission (EC) is trying to unlock this potential, the 2004 Public Procurement Directives 2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC 
introduced several provisions and projects~\cite{peppol,e-certis} aimed at enabling e-Procurement uptake in all Member States. In this light of 
modernizing the European public procurement sector to support growth and employment the EC also identified~\cite{siemensEval} 
both regulatory and natural barriers in the access to public procurement in the EU context, especially for SMEs. 
According to this evaluation, a real European Single Market use~\cite{d2011} has not yet been achieved causing losses, 
being cost-inefficient, missing opportunities for society and leading to a situation where more than 27 national markets co-exist instead of an EU-wide public market~\cite{monti2010}. 
In this sense, one relevant action to ease the interconnectivity and interoperability in this landscape was the creation of the Tenders Electronic Daily~\cite{eNotices,formsTed} (TED) 
by the EC. It is the on-line version of the ``Supplement to the Official Journal of the European Union'', dedicated to European public procurement notices 
($1500$ new announcements every day) but a unified pan-European information system dealing with: dispersion of the information, 
duplication of the same notice in more than one source, different publishing formats, problems with regards to a multilingual environment and 
aggregation of low-value procurement opportunities, is still missing. As a consequence some of the potential advantages 
outlined by the EC~\cite{d2010} such as increased accessibility and transparency, benefits for individual procedures, 
benefits in terms of more efficient procurement administration and potential for integration of EU procurement markets cannot be reached in a 
short-term.

Furthermore other EU actions in the e-Government context have been focused on the development of conceptual/terminological maps available in the Eurostat's metadata server (RAMON): 
in the Health field, the ``European Schedule of Occupational Diseases'' or  the ``International Classification of Diseases''; in the Education field,  
thesauri as the ``European Education Thesaurus''; in the Employment field, the ``International Standard Classification of Occupations''; 
in the European Parliament activities the ``Eurovoc Thesaurus'' and in the e-Procurement field the ``Common Procurement Vocabulary'' (CPV). 
The structure and features of these systems are very heterogeneous, although some common aspects can be found in all of them: hierarchical relationships between terms or concepts and multilingual character of the information. 
These knowledge organization systems (KOS) enable users to annotate information objects providing an agile mechanism for performing 
tasks such as exploration, searching, automatic classification or reasoning. Nevertheless depending on the country and the scope 
distinct classifications are commonly used. In the specific case of e-Procurement, the United Nations Standard Products and Services Code (UNSPSC) in Australia, 
the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) in United States or the CPV and TARIC (Integrated Tariff of the European Communities) in the European Union 
are examples of similar efforts to unify and model procurement-related data. As a consequence a real, standardized and integrated environment 
for e-Procurement (and business) data to encourage the creation of knowledge-based services cannot be easily deployed. In this sense the 
``European Code of Best Practices Facilitating Access by SMEs to Public Procurement Contracts''~\cite{d2008} pointed out 
two groups of difficulties regarding the barriers faced by SMEs in accessing relevant information about public procurement opportunities. 
The document stated that ``the (big) number of such web portals being used by the government and by regional and local authorities makes it difficult 
for tenderers to maintain an overview''. By aggregating data on public procurement in all Member States 
and at all administrative levels in a standardized way and reusing existing efforts of modeling 
and classifying domain knowledge, some open and critical issues can be tackled to improve a situation which affects more 
than \euro $20$ million non-financial companies established in the EU.


On the other hand and following the principles of the Open Data initiative, the vice-president Neelie Kroes is leading the Open Data Strategy for Europe. 
She also outlined in December 2011 several types of actions that will help to unleash potential of data held by governments in Europe. The strategy is 
strongly focused on the commercial value of the re-use of Public Sector Information (PSI), by which the Commission expects to deliver a \euro 40 billion boost to the EU's economy each year. 
A new version of the 2003 Public Sector Information Directive~\cite{d2003} is also expected and the EC is strongly determined to act as a global leader along with United States, 
Canada or Australia. This open data is supposed to enable greater transparency; delivers more efficient public services; and encourages greater 
public and commercial use. More specifically in the context of e-Procurement the access to public contracts announcements is the first natural 
step to encourage SME participation and create a real public market of procurement opportunities.


Moreover, the emerging Web of Data and the sheer mass of information now available make it possible the deployment of new 
added-value services and applications based on the reuse of existing vocabularies and datasets. 
The popular diagram of the Linked Data Cloud~\cite{linked-data-cloud}, generated from metadata extracted from the 
Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network (CKAN) out, contains $336$ datasets, with more than 25 billion RDF triples and 395 million links. 
With regards to e-Procurement, a new group of 130 CKAN datasets have been released from the ``OpenSpending.org'' site. In this realm, 
data coming from different sources and domains have been promoted following the principles of the 
Linked Data initiative~\cite{Berners-Lee-2006} to improve the access to large documental databases, 
e.g. e-Government resources, scientific publications or e-Health records. In the case of KOS, such as thesauri, taxonomies or classification systems 
are developed by specific communities and institutions in order to organize huge collections of information objects. 
These vocabularies allow users to annotate~\cite{Leukel-standard,Leukel-automating,Leukel-comparative} the information objects and easily retrieve them, 
promoting lightweight reasoning in the Semantic Web. Topic or subject indexing is an easy way to introduce machine-readable metadata for a resource's content 
description. Indeed, Product Scheme Classifications (also known as PSCs), such as the CPV, are a kind of KOS that have been built to solve specific problems 
of interoperability and communication between e-Commerce agents~\cite{FenselOmel2001,Leukel-findings}, in the particular case of PSCs they are considered to be a key-enabler of 
the next European e-Procurement domain and other supply chain processes~\cite{DBLP:journals/tcci/Alor-HernandezAJPRMBG10}.

Obviously the public information published by governmental contracting authorities, more specifically PSCs, are a suitable candidate to apply the Linked (Open) Data 
(LOD) principles and semantic web technologies providing a new environment in which the conjunction of these initiatives can provide the building blocks for an 
innovative unified pan-European information system that encourages standardization of key processes and systems and gives economic operators the tools to overcome 
technical interoperability easing and enhancing the access and reuse of public information. Therefore main contributions of this paper lay in:
\begin{itemize}
\item Modeling, transforming and interlinking the structure and data of PSCs developed by public bodies following the LOD principles.
\item Publishing all information via an SPARQL endpoint providing a public procurement Linked Data node and, more specifically, a new PSCs catalogue as Linked Data.
\item Exploiting the aforementioned catalogue via a contract descriptor recommendation service.
\item Demonstrating the gain (in terms of number of descriptors to retrieve public procurement notices) and the semantic exploitation 
capabilities of the new PSCs catalogue.
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section~\ref{sect:related-work} reviews the relevant literature. Next thesauri 
conversion methods are outlined. Section~\ref{sect:method} presents the application of a method for promoting raw data to the LOD initiative 
and its application to the PSCs in the European e-Procurement sector. Section~\ref{sect:evaluation} describes the evaluation of applying the LOD principles to 
these product schemes through two studies that include a description of the sample, the method, results and discussion. Finally, 
the paper ends with a discussion of research findings, limitations and some concluding remarks.
