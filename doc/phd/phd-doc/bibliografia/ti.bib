	abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The Web has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series of modifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspects of the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for the modern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment.Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best to partition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, how information is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, and how all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of networkbased application software through principled use of architectural constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. An architectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints.This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture via architectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architectural design of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles for network-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architectural properties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style and describe how REST has been used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web. REST emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles.Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying REST to the design of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequent deployment in Web client and server software.},

	abstract={Service-oriented computing has become one of the predominant factors in current IT research and development. Web services seem to be the middleware solution of the future for highly interoperable distributed software solutions. In parallel, research on the Semantic Web provides the results required to exploit distributed machine-processable data. To combine these two research lines into industrial-strength applications, a number of research projects have been set up by organizations like W3C and the EU.
Dieter Fensel and his coauthors deliver a profound introduction into one of the most promising approaches the Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO). After a brief presentation of the underlying basic technologies and standards of the World Wide Web, the Semantic Web, and Web Services, they detail all the elements of WSMO from basic concepts to possible applications in e-commerce, e-government and e-banking, and they also describe its relation to other approaches like OWL-S or WSDL-S.
While many of the related technologies and standards are still under development, this book already offers both a broad conceptual introduction and lots of pointers to future application scenarios for researchers in academia and industry as well as for developers of distributed Web applications.},

  abstract = {Semantic Web services promise to automate tasks such as discovery,
	mediation, selection, composition, and invocation of services, enabling
	fully flexible automated e-business. Their usage, however, still
	requires a significant amount of human intervention due to the lack
	of support for a machine-processable description.
	
	In this book, Jos de Bruijn and his coauthors lay the foundations
	for understanding the requirements that shape the description of
	the various aspects related to Semantic Web services, such as the
	static background knowledge in the form of ontologies, the functional
	description of the service, and the behavioral description of the
	service. They introduce the Web Service Modeling Language (WSML),
	which provides means for describing the functionality and behavior
	of Web services, as well as the underlying business knowledge, in
	the form of ontologies, with a conceptual grounding in the Web Service
	Modeling Ontology.
	
	Academic and industrial researchers as well as professionals will
	find a comprehensive overview of the concepts and challenges in the
	area of Semantic Web services, the Web Services Modeling Language
	and its relation to the Web Services Modeling Ontology, and an in-depth
	treatment of both enabling technologies and theoretical foundations.}
