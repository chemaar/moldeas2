  abstract =     "The importance of a Web page is an inherently
                 subjective matter, which depends on the readers
                 interests, knowledge and attitudes. But there is still
                 much that can be said objectively about the relative
                 importance of Web pages. This paper describes PageRank,
                 a mathod for rating Web pages objectively and
                 mechanically, effectively measuring the human interest
                 and attention devoted to them. We compare PageRank to
                 an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to
                 efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of
                 pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and
                 to user navigation.",
